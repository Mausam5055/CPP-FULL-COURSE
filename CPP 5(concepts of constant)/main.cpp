//  HEADING: CONCEP OF CONSTANTS

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){ 
short a;
 int b;
 long c;
 long long d;
 float const score1 = 45.32;
 double score2= 45.322;
 long double score3 = 45.332;
 score1 = 34.2
 cout<<"The score is"<<score2;

    return 0;}

//    NOTES:  1.in above we wrote score1=34.2 but also we mentioned 
//              in above that score1 is a constant having a 
//              fixed vale of 43.32 so for which our score1
//              cant have two values and so if we run code like this 
//              we will get error, 



//              2.But if we wouldnt have mentioned that our 
//              score1 is constant and jst simply wrote 'float score1= 45.32'
//              and then at last we wrote again 'score1=34.2'
//              and then if we run the code we will get no error and the 
//              vs code will print us the later score1 value(i.e. 34.2)




//            3. This concept of constant is used in several cases 
                 /* eg. in a company we are to save the birth data of employess
                 and as the birth date of  each and every employee is fixed ,
                 so to keep the birth date fixed we use 'constant' function */
