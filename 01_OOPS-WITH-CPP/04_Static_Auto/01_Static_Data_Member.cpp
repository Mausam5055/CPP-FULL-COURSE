// 🎯 What is static in a class?
// Normally, when We create objects from a class, each object gets its own 
// copy from all the data members that we defined inside the class .

// But when we write a variable as static, it becomes common/shared for all 
// objects — (Eg.like one single notebook and all students write in.)

// 🧠 Think Like This:
// 👤 Object A → has its own data
// 👤 Object B → has its own data
// 🗒️ But static variable? → Only one copy exists, shared by A, B, and C.
