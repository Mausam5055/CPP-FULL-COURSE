//HEADING : CAMEL CASE NOTATION

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int marksInMaths=83;
    cout<<marksInMaths;
}

 //NOTES: 1.  in above we used camel case notation i.e. in the word 'marksInMaths'
 //         we used "m" of marks in small letter
 //         we used "i" of in in capital letter
 //         we used "m" of maths in capital letter
 //         and then we typed 'mim'the vs code detected it as marksInMaths


//        2. we can also write in above as 
//             cout<<"The marks of the student in maths is"<<marksInMaths;
